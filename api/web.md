## Elements

Elements is a React UI Component and utility library we have developed internally and open sourced. The Developer Portal and Marketplace itself uses Elements extensively and if you are building a React app to be installed by clients, we recommend you do too.

When using this page, you can toggle between code examples and rendered output of components by using the ‘Canvas’ and ‘Docs’ tabs. For general usage and other NPM packages, visit the package documentation.

## Foundations TS Definitions

Develop in TypeScript against the Reapit Foundations Platform with confidence

If you are using TypeScript \(and we recommend you do!\), for your front end project, we provide full type definitions for the API documented in the [API explorer](https://github.com/reapit/foundations-documentation/tree/db0718c9be27b7760dfae34e69518806acf0e855/developer/swagger/README.md). We generate these types from the Swagger contracts direct so you can be sure that when the API changes, your types will be updated also. This allows for a much closer alignment between front and back end development and ultimately more robust applications.

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The definitions are updated automatically when the API changes. As such, it is recommended strongly that 
{% endhint %}

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}



## Web Components

In addition to the Elements React component toolkit, Reapit will soon be offering a number of other downloadable Front End Resources. 

These may be modular blocks of functionality that can be embedded within your site, toolsets or even CMS friendly bundles of scripts available elsewhere. The guiding principles of the project is that the components should be standalone, highly customisable and lightweight. 

These are under active development by our team with an Alpha release in the coming months. You can check on progress [here.](https://github.com/reapit/foundations/milestone/6)
