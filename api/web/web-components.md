# Web Components

## Web Components

In addition to the Elements React component toolkit, Reapit will soon be offering a number of other downloadable Front End Resources. 

These may be modular blocks of functionality that can be embedded within your site, toolsets or even CMS friendly bundles of scripts available elsewhere. The guiding principles of the project is that the components should be standalone, highly customisable and lightweight. 

These are under active development by our team with an Alpha release in the coming months. You can check on progress [here.](https://github.com/reapit/foundations/milestone/6)
