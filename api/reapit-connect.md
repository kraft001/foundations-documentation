# Reapit Connect

## Introduction

**Reapit Connect** is our hosted identity solution designed to allow applications to securely authenticate Reapit users against a single, trusted identity. 

Backed by our OpenID Connect compliant system, it is quick and easy to build applications that adhere to best security practices and extend an excellent experience to your users.

Building your application with Reapit Connect is our **recommended way** to interact with our Platform. Here's why:

#### Simplicity

Reapit Connect removes the overhead of having to build and maintain a user credential directory for your app. Instead, users can be securely authenticated against a single, trusted Reapit identity and directed back to your application

We present information about the user on successful authentication that you can optionally use to register them in your own system, if you require. 

#### Single sign on

Reapit Connect supports single sign on \(SSO\) to allow authenticated sessions to be shared between any application using Reapit Connect to manage it's authentication requirement. This means that if a user has already authenticated with Reapit Connect, that session is remembered and the experience of interacting with your application is streamlined as users aren't re-prompted for their credentials.    

**Security**

Our identity provision is an implementation of OpenId Connect, the defacto industry standard for authentication and authorisation for web and mobile applications. 

OpenId Connect provides an authentication layer over the widely adopted OAuth 2.0 standard which allows your application to be authorised on behalf of a user. Simply put, you don't need to worry about  securely capturing or storing user credentials - we do that part for you. 

#### Cross platform

You can use Reapit Connect to authenticate users regardless of the front or back end technologies you have chosen for your application. Reapit Connect is agnostic of technology and integration is as simple as a redirect to our hosted login screen and a subsequent REST API call.

#### Trust

Your users will be presented with a unified login screen from a brand they already know and trust. They will receive the same user experience as they do from other Reapit applications and of those that exist in our marketplace.
