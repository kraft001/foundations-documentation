# Home

The documentation is split between the API and our Open Source Packages.

API usage documentation is again split between the [Foundations REST API](https://marketplace.reapit.cloud/developer/api-docs) for querying the Reapit data platform, the[ Desktop API](api/desktop-api.md) which is relevant to interactions between web-apps and [Reapit Agency Cloud](https://www.reapit.com/agency-cloud/), the [Reapit Connect OAuth](api/reapit-connect.md) single sign on service, and finally, the [NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/org/reapit) we support for w[eb development. ](api/web/)

We are currently in Alpha and are both making daily code changes and updating these pages. Should you find any issues, anything that is unclear or any inaccuracies in the documentation, please [visit here](https://github.com/reapit/foundations-documentation/issues/new?labels=bug&projects=reapit/foundations-documentation/1&body=Summary:) to let us know.
